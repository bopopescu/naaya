TODOs:
------------------------------------------------------------
[X] RDF Calendar CSS (RTL and LTR)
[X] maybe add a Naaya Glossary for the 'Geographical coverage'/'Country' property of the
    SMAP Project objects instead of the countries reflist
[X] Project search: 1) to implement indexing of the 'SMAP Project' fields
                    2) search functionality (ZPT and SMAPSite.py)
                    3) sort by colomn on the result page
[ ] The 'Focus of the project' values must change accordingly to the selected 'Project Area' value
        - on project and expert objects
        - on search form
[ ] HTML/CSS of projects search form
[ ] From the old SMAP product: search engine problems/issues
