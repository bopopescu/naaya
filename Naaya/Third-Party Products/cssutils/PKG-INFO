Description: A Python package to parse and build CSS Cascading Style Sheets.
        Partly implements the DOM Level 2 CSS interfaces.
        Additional some cssutils only convenience and (hopefully) more pythonic
        methods are integrated.
        
        Cssutils starting point was normalization and pretty printing of given CSS
        files to be able to compare them more easily. It then developed into
        something similar what the DOM CSS interfaces would do anyway, so it went
        from there...
        Additionally a focus should be on the various CSS hacks that were developed
        to overcome several browser CSS incompabilities. Cssutils should at least
        be able to preserve these hacks.
